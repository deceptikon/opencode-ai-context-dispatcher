# 🤖 Agent Onboarding & Context Guide: Context Dispatcher Core

Welcome, Agent! This project uses the **OpenCode Context Dispatcher** to manage project-specific knowledge, rules, and workflows.

## 🆔 Project Identity
- **Project Name**: Context Dispatcher Core
- **Project ID**: 3da7ab8253e7d441

## 🚀 How to Onboard Yourself
If you are new to this project or the context feels "cold", follow these steps to warm up:

### 1. Load Full Context
Get all established rules, documentation, and code structure:
```bash
ctx get-full 3da7ab8253e7d441
```

### 2. Semantic Exploration
If you need to understand *how* something works conceptually:
```bash
ctx search-v 3da7ab8253e7d441 "how does the authentication flow work?"
```

### 3. Identify Tools & Workflows
Check for project-specific commands (testing, linting, building):
```bash
ctx get-docs 3da7ab8253e7d441 rule
```

## 🛠 Essential Commands
- \`ctx list-docs 3da7ab8253e7d441\` - See all available documentation
- \`ctx stats 3da7ab8253e7d441\` - Check indexing status
- \`ctx update 3da7ab8253e7d441\` - Sync latest git changes to context

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CLI vs AI Tool
\`ctx\` is a **CLI COMMAND**, not an AI tool. You must run it via your \`bash\` tool.
- ❌ **DO NOT** try to call \`ctx.get_docs()\`
- ✅ **DO** run \`bash { command: "ctx get-docs ..." }\`

## ✍️ Contributing to Context
When you discover a new pattern, fix a complex bug, or identify a recurring issue, **save it for future agents**:

```bash
# Add a new rule
ctx add-doc 3da7ab8253e7d441 rule "Always use 'uv run pytest' for testing" "Testing Standard"

# Add a workflow note
ctx add-doc 3da7ab8253e7d441 note "To fix DB migration issues, run: rm dev.db && python manage.py migrate" "DB Troubleshooting"
```

## 📋 Onboarding Checklist (For First Session)
If this is the first time an agent is working here, please:
1. [ ] Explore the directory structure (`ls -R`)
2. [ ] Identify the tech stack (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
3. [ ] Test the build/test commands
4. [ ] Document your findings using `ctx add-doc`
